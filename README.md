Iâ€™m a Computer Scientist who enjoys building practical solutions and learning new tools along the way. I like clean code, experimenting with ideas, and collaborating on projects that make an impact. Always improving, always curious.

Iâ€™m really into cybersecurity, machine learning, and embedded systems. I like digging into how things work under the hoodâ€”whether thatâ€™s protecting systems, training models, or working with hardware.
